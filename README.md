3. Click on the `Add Widget` or the blue plus button then click `Static/Custom` then `Custom Widget`
4. Click the `Open Editor` button, this will open a code editor with five widows
5. Copy and paste the code from this repo into those code windows.
   - The htmlcode.html into the HTML window
   - The CSS window will be blank
   - jscode.js code into the JS window
   - fields.json into the fields window
   - the data window can be blank (it will automatically fill when you input the settings from the settings menu)
